The serial collector is selected by default on certain hardware and operating system configurations, or can be explicitly enabled with the option <strong>-XX:+UseSerialGC</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Parallel Collector</h2>\n<p>It’s also known as throughput collector, it’s a generational collector similar to the serial collector. The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple threads which are used to speed up garbage collection.\r\nThe parallel collector is intended for applications with medium-sized to large-sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor hardware. You can enable it by using the <strong>-XX:-UseParallelGC</strong> option.</p>\n<h2>The Mostly Concurrent Collectors</h2>\n<p>Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector and Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector are the two mostly concurrent collectors. Mostly concurrent collectors perform some expensive work concurrently to the application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>G1 garbage collector: This server-style collector is for multiprocessor machines with a large amount of memory. It meets garbage collection pause-time goals with high probability, it can be explicitly enabled using -XX:+UseG1GC.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CMS collector: this collector is for applications that prefer shorter garbage collection pauses and can afford to share processor resources with the garbage collection, this collector is deprecated from JDK 9.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Z Garbage Collector</h2>\n<p>It’s a scalable low latency garbage collector. ZGC performs all expensive work concurrently, without stopping the execution of application threads. ZGC is intended for applications which require low latency (less than 10 ms pauses)\r\nand/or use a very large heap. You can enable by using the <strong>-XX:+UseZGC</strong> option. It’s available from JDK 11.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Available Collectors","date":"July 02, 2021","description":"The Java HotSpot VM includes three different types of collectors, each with different performance characteristics."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/factors-Affecting-Garbage-collection-Performance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Factors Affecting Garbage Collection Performance"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/garbage-First-Collector/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Garbage-First Garbage Collector"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d1544d67-ea60-5739-8f10-97a51f659694","previousPostId":"c1b9194b-f2a8-52a4-abc1-6a382418872b","nextPostId":"58ce87c3-e35e-5059-b64d-f05d4082df9e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["230163734","2841359383"]}
